```python
Python CLI tool for automatic review scheduling
```

## 🌎OVERVIEW

Through a command-line interface, the program enables users to input study topics and, using a Python algorithm, calculates future review dates for the selected content. These dates are then exported as a calendar file (.ics), allowing users to easily visualize and manage their review schedule in any compatible calendar application.

#### 🧪THE STUDY TECHNIQUE

Spaced repetition is a learning method that involves reviewing information at systematically increasing intervals over time. Instead of cramming material in a single, intensive session, this technique schedules follow-up reviews just as one is about to forget the previously studied content. The core principle is to counteract the natural curve of forgetting by reintroducing the material at the precise moment before it fades from memory, thereby making study sessions more efficient and effective.

This technique strengthens long-term memory through two key psychological mechanisms: the spacing effect and the testing effect. The spacing effect demonstrates that information is better remembered when exposure is distributed across multiple, separated sessions rather than massed into one. Each review session reactivates and reconsolidates the memory trace, making it more durable and resistant to forgetting. Concurrently, the testing effect (or active recall) is engaged because each review requires actively retrieving the information from memory. This act of retrieval is a powerful memory exercise that strengthens neural pathways and builds stronger, more accessible long-term memories. By combining optimally timed intervals with active recall, spaced repetition effectively transfers knowledge from fragile short-term memory into robust, long-term retention.
